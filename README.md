# About me
Hello! My name is Elizaveta. I'm 20 years old. Now I want to start a career in IT. I like front-end, but I think I have capabilities in management, so I want to try myself in project management.
I like to plan and distribute tasks and I make it during group university tasks. I want to learn how to communicate with people and colleagues. I want to grow in this sphere and become a great specialist.
I know a lot about web-development. I finished courses on front-end development. But I think It's more interesting for me to organize work in company, to make plans and rise efficiency of work. I think it's mine and I want to try myself in it.
## Education
I'm a student of BSEU, Faculty of Digital Economy, 3rd course, Economical Informatics.

## English
I think my level is B1+. I think I'm a good English speaker and have a good pronunciation. I understand the text I read and the speech I hear. I also have a skill of writing in English and this CV is the confirmation of this fact. I don't have a certificate about English level, but I passed the centralized testing for 92 points. Now I continue to develop my English level.
