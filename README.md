# About me
Hello! My name is Elizaveta. I'm 20 year old. Now I want to start career in IT. I like front-end, but I think I have capabilities in management, so I also want to try myself in project management.
I like to plan and distribute tasks. I want to learn how to communicate with people and colleagues. I want to grow in this sphere and become a great specialist.
I know a lot about web-development. I finished courses on front-end development. But I think It's more interesting for me to organise work in company, to make plans and rise efficiency of work. I think it's mine and I want to try myself in it.
## Skills
1. Front-end development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, SASS)
2. MS Office (Access, Excel, Project, PowerPoint)
3. Trello
4. Figma
5. SQL
6. Git
I can quickly master any software product.
## English
I think my level is B1+. I think I'm a good english speaker and have a good pronunciation. I understand the text I read and the speech I hear. I also have a skill of writting in english and this CV is the confirmation of this fact. I don't have a certificate about english level, but I passed the centralized testing for 92 points. Now I continue to develope my english level.
